h1. MongoMapper Multi-Modifiers

This is a plugin for MongoMapper that allows updates to multiple fields in a single document within a single update call.

h2. Example

<pre><code>
Foo.modify(:title => "My Favorite Colors") do
  push(:colors => ["red", "blue"])
  increment(:num_colors => 2)
end
</code></pre>

h2. TODO

* Gem spec
* Look at how BulkModifier evaluates its block and see if there's a cleaner way.
